not only have a responsibility of staying safe and observing all safety requirement. 
It is important also that our community is held to a high standard of accountability. 
It is expected that drivers or riders exhibit high level of compliance with the NCDC 
general safety guidelines. This includes not having to use any form of public 
transportation when diagnosed with COVID-19, assessed for it or suspect being 
exposed to it.
Our safety is further ensured when we show a collective responsibility
